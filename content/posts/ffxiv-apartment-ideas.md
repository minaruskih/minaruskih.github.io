2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility. However, there also opportunities for progress. The biggest challenge facing the US was the increasing support for secessionist movements such as the "Brexit" vote in Britain and the workshopping of a new tax code that would have lowered rates for businesses. Other key issues include Bureaucratic red tape, healthcare reform, and gun control. In Europe, problems including Brexit and population growth made it difficult to agree on policies to address these issues. Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for progress. For example, in France, Emmanuel Macron has been successful in making his country more competitive by focusing on innovation and job creation. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.

Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!
