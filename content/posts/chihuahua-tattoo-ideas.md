Conclusion: Is a DIY project right for you?
A do-it-yourself project can be a great way to save money, but it’s not right for everyone. Here are some things to consider before starting a DIY project.
Time: A DIY project will take longer than hiring a professional, so be sure you have the time to commit.

Cost: The initial cost of a DIY project may be cheaper, but if you make mistakes, it can end up costing more in the long run.

Skill Level: Not all projects are created equal. Some are much easier than others. Be honest with yourself about your skill level and whether or not you can handle the project.

Tools and Materials: You’ll need more than just a few tools and materials for most projects. Make sure you have everything you need before starting.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.
