Main Points: New ideas can improve things like productivity, happiness, and social interaction.
The research on new ideas screams out for change - and that’s where the concept of “personalization” comes in. Personalization is the process of creating unique, customized experiences for customers by adding their own personality traits or preferences to products or services.

But there are also a number of drawbacks, including increased costs and decreased efficiency.
