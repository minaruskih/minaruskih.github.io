The Power of Big Ideas
The power of big ideas is at the root of most innovation. Ideas that are large enough to engage people and make a difference can touch every aspect of our lives. From the simplest things to the biggest challenges, big ideas can impact everything and everyone around them.
There are a number of ways to create big ideas, but some are easier than others. One approach is to come up with a concept that you’re passionate about and then explore what others have said about it.

Whatever method you choose, remember that big ideas are worth pursuing – no matter how challenging or difficult they may seem at first.

How to have big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. But, having big ideas is essential for innovation and progress. Here are a few ways to have big ideas:
1) Be curious and ask lots of questions. When you're curious about something, you're more likely to come up with new and interesting ideas about it. So, ask lots of questions and explore the things that interest you.

2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.
