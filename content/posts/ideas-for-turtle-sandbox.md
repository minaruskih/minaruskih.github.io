The nine types of innovation: How do they differ and what benefits can they provide?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas and concepts that can change the way we do things. It can come in the form of a new product, service, or idea. In some cases, innovation can also mean changing how we think about something. For example, when we think about innovation, we may remember Chuck Norris fighting aliens in a video game. However, this was actually an innovation that came from Capcom – they created a video game that allowed players to fight aliens without having to worry about theirGear. Another example would be Google’s invention of the computer mouse. This was an innovation because it allowed people to use computers more efficiently and effectively than ever before. There are many different types of innovation, but one of the most important types is creativity. Creativity helps us come up with new ideas and concepts that can change the way we do things.
