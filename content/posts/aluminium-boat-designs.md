What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.

Overcoming Writer's Block: What to do when you can't seem to come up with anything.
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. Here are a few ideas to help you overcome writer's block and start getting your thoughts down on paper.
First, take a break. Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, your brain just needs a break. Get up and walk around, do something else for a little while, and then come back to your writing with fresh eyes.

Second, try brainstorming. Get a piece of paper and write down whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly or unrelated it may seem. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and figuring out which ones you want to explore further in your writing.

Third, ask yourself some questions. What are you trying to say with your writing? What are you hoping to accomplish?
