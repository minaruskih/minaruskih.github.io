Brainstroming is a process that helps people focus and think clearly. It's a type of concentration exercise that uses the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe is responsible for thinking, planning, and making decisions. It's also responsible for regulating emotions and controlling behavior. Brainstroming is effective when used in combinations with other aspects of concentration, such as practice, relaxation, and meditation.
