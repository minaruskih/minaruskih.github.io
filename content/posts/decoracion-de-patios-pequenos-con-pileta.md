What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, that’s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.
