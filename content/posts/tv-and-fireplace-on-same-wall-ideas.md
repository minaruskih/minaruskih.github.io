The role of creativity in art: What does it mean for the artist?
Creativity has been in the eye of the beholder since Antiquity. Whether it be in painting, architecture or music, creativity is what makes art. However, what does creativity actually mean for an artist? In classical times, creativity was considered to be a gift from God. Today, we understand that creativity is something that can be developed through practice and practice can take many different forms. For example, a musician may learn how to play an instrument and then use that knowledge to create new music. An artist may learn how to paint and then use their creative skills to create works of art. While there is no set definition for creativity, most agree that it includes the ability to see things differently than others and to come up with new ideas. In other words, creativity is a state of being where one's thoughts and feelings drive their actions.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they also come with risk. If your idea is too risky, it won’t get traction and may never see the light of day. That’s why it’s essential to be sure your idea is worth taking on. There are a few key principles that help make an idea a good one: It should be something people want or need; it should be novel and have potential to change the world; it should have a commercial Potential; and it should be feasible to execute. Here are three examples of ideas that researchers at Imperial College London say might just be worth pursuing:

Idea 2: A way to track fitness progress and keep track of calories burned.
There are many ways to track fitness progress and calories burned, but one popular way is to use a pedometer. A pedometer tracks steps taken and the number of calories burned, which can be helpful in understanding how much exercise you're doing and how much weight you've lost. Another common way to track fitness progress is to use a Garminbrace. This tracking device records your physical activity data and stores it on a computer. You can then see your average caloric burn for each day or week, as well as your overall progress over time.
