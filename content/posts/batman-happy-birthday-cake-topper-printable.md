Invention ideas come from a variety of sources, including inspiration, observation, and trial and error. The inventor typically starts with an idea that they believe in and then looks for ways to improve on it. They may also reference others who have had similar ideas to help them come up with their own version of the idea. Once they have a good idea, they continue to explore ways to make it more effective or efficient.
