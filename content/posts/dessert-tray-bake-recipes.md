The power of a big idea: can change the way we think and see the world
Big ideas have the power to change the way we think and see the world. They can challenge our assumptions and help us to see things in new ways.


For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?

Definition of big ideas: What is it, and why should we care?
The definition of big ideas can vary greatly, but typically they refer to ideas that could have a significant impact on society or the world. Big ideas are usually long-term and require thought and effort to put into fruition, so they're important not just for businesses but also for government and social organizations. Here are five definitions of big ideas that may help make them more clear:
1) A big idea is an innovative solution or plan that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
2) A big idea is a new way of thinking about something that's been around for a while but hasn't been fully explored.
3) An idea with potential to create jobs, boost economy, or improve education is often called a big idea.
