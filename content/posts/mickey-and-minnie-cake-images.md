2020: The United States and China’s new relationship
As the world's two biggest economies start to elbow each other in 2020, it is important to ask what their new relationship will be. What are the key topics of discussion? What challenges does 2020 bring for the two countries? And is there anything in common between them that could help make their relationship stronger?
One area where China and the United States do have some similarities is their commitment to innovation. Beijing has long championed creativity as a way to improve society, and US President Donald Trump has also made innovation one of his priorities. In 2020, this focus will be put into full force as both countries fight against climate change – an issue that China has been advocating for years.

Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.
