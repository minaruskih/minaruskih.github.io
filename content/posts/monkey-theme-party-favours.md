Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, or a new way of doing something. It can be anything from a simple improvement to an entire new product. In some cases, inventions come about as a result of chance meetings or shared interests. Other times, inventors spend years planning and working on their ideas until they have a real plan for making their invention a reality.

The challenges of innovation
Every business wants to be innovative. But how do you go about being innovative when you're small and new? The challenges of innovation are just as extensive as the opportunities. Here are a few tips to help you navigate them:
1. Keep your ideas open. When you come up with a new idea, keep in mind that there's always room for improvement. You might not have initially thought of it this way, but if your idea is good enough, someone else might eventually come up with a better solution or an even better way to do things. Be open to suggestions and feedback from others before you give your idea any serious consideration.

2. Don't be afraid to take risks. When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to take on whatever challenge seems daunting or even impossible at first.
