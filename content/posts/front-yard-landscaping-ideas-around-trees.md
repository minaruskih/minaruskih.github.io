Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. If you don't have any, you'll be at a disadvantage in your competition. To have ideas is to be flexible and creative, but it's also to be open-minded and willing to change. There are a few key benefits of using ideas:

2) You will learn more quickly. When you have an idea, your brain starts working overtime trying to come up with a solution.
