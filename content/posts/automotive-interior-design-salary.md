Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.

definition of innovation
One of the key concepts in innovation is the definition of what it is. Innovation can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created. This definition could be used to describe many different aspects of innovation, but some are more important than others. For example, innovation can be used to describe the process by which new products are created, or the process by which new ideas are developed.

There are a few different ways to achieve innovation. One way is to brainstorm new ideas and see if anyone has any that you think could work well. Another way is to test out products or services before they're released to see if they work well and if there's enough demand for them. There's also the option of learning from experts and watching them create innovative products or services.
