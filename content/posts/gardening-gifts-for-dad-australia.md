How to come up with big ideas
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, the first step is to have a clear idea of what you want your business to achieve. Once you know what you want, it's time to start thinking about how you can achieve it. Here are four tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1. Look at your industry and think about how you could improve it. Why isn't there enough innovation in this industry? Why are some products more popular than others? What could be done to make sure that your product or service is better?
2. Come up with a goal that you can focus on and work towards. This will help give you the motivation to keep going when the going gets tough. Without a goal, it's hard to stay motivated and keep exploring new ideas. 
3. Make a list of possible ways that your business could improve.
