How to have big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. But, having big ideas is essential for innovation and progress. Here are a few ways to have big ideas:
1) Be curious and ask lots of questions. When you're curious about something, you're more likely to come up with new and interesting ideas about it. So, ask lots of questions and explore the things that interest you.

2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.

Outdoor projects: How to fix a broken window, install a new deck, or repaint your house.
If you're looking to fix a broken window or install a new deck, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some easy diy projects to get started:
1. Fix a Broken Window

One way to fix a broken window is to use your hands. Get some adhesive and put it on the inside of the windowpane. Once it's set, hold onto the edge of the adhesive and pull the window open. You could also use screws if the window frame is strong enough to hold itself together without help. If all of this doesn't work, call a professional!

2. Install a New Deck or Decking

Another option for fixing a broken window is to install new decking or railing. This can be done either in-home or at an outdoor location.

Category: Creative Ideas
Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
