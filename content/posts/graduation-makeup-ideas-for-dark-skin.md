Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They're the solutions to problems that have never been solved, and they can be the spark that ignites a company's competitive advantage. To find big ideas, your startup must first identify its biggest challenges and then identify the opportunities that could solve them. Then, you must come up with the best ways to execute on those ideas, and finally get your company off the ground by marketeering and publicizing your big ideas.

Creativity is an innate quality that many people take for granted. However, without effort, creativity can often be wasted. For example, if you're creative in your artwork but don't have any ideas for products, you may not be successful in business. To be successful, creativity must come from the inside out – with ideas and solutions rather than just pictures in your head.
