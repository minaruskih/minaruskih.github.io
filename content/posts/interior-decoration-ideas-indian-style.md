CreativeWork: What makes a good creative idea?
Creative ideas are not only great for businesses, but also for individuals. Whether you’re a creative artist or just want to come up with new ideas, creativity is essential. There are certain things that make good creative ideas, and these are often based on your own experience or what you’ve learned. Here are some things to consider when coming up with your next idea: 
1) What is your target audience? When you come up with an idea, be sure to think about what kind of message or product you’d like to reach out to. Is it just for yourself, or do you have an audience in mind? 
2) What can you realistically accomplish? Are there any challenges that you can overcome using your creativity? If so, make sure they’re still worth considering.
