Printing press
In 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which revolutionized how information was disseminated. For the first time in history, knowledge was not restricted to those who could read and write; it could be shared with anyone who could operate a printing press. The ability to mass-produce printed materials quickly and cheaply made it possible for people to access a wide range of information that was previously only available to a select few.
The invention of the printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge, and played a key role in shaping the course of history. Today, the printing press is an essential tool for businesses, schools, and individuals around the world.

The effects of innovation on society:
Innovation is a process of change in any field, let alone business. When it comes to the world of business, innovation can mean anything from the introduction of a new product to the redesign of an entire company. In this day and age, businesses must constantly be on the lookout for new ideas and solutions to their problems in order to stay afloat and make a profit.
However, while innovation can have positive effects on society as a whole, it also has its downside. The most common issue with innovation is that it can drive up Costs and decrease Profit margins. In recent years, there has been an increase in companies that are implementing innovative methods without considering the consequences first. This has resulted in increased costs for consumers and businesses alike, which has caused them to lose out on potential revenue.

5. External Review and recommendation: How do you get feedback from others about your idea?
When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends? There are a few ways to get feedback, but the most effective way is through an external review and recommendation. External reviews can help assess whether your idea is worth pursuing and, if so, whether there are any potential roadblocks that need to be addressed.
