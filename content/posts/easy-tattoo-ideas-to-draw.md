How to come up with big ideas
Thereâ€™s no one answer to the question of how to come up with big ideas. But by understanding the process that goes into creating big ideas, you can better appreciate and embrace those that come your way. Here are a few tips:
1. Start with a question: What do you want to achieve?
2. Get organized: This is where things get interesting. By coming up with a specific goal, you can start to imagine all the possible ways your solution could work and which aspects of your business could benefit from it. This will help you narrow down your options and coalesce them into a more reasonable, manageable project.
3. Break it down: Once you have identified what you want, break it down into smaller goals or areas of focus that are easier to manage and achieve.
