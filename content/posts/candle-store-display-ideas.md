Define brainstorming.
Brainstorming is a process that allows you to generate ideas and solutions by working with a group. The goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or evaluating them. This can be done by writing down all the ideas that come to mind, or by using a technique called "brainstorming." Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. The key to effective brainstorming is to suspend judgment and allow the free flow of ideas.

How do we become involved in the invention process?
Invention is a process where people come up with new ideas for products or services. It can be difficult to come up with new ideas, but there are many ways to get involved in the process. There are several ways to become involved in the invention process, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One way to become involved in the invention process is to attend an inventor's mixer. An inventor's mixer allows people to share their ideas with other inventors and potential customers. It can also help people develop their ideas more effectively.

Another way to become involved in the invention process is by working on a project with another person. When you are working with someone else, you have a better chance of developing your idea together and making it a reality. This is important because it can help you learn about other people's concepts and how they would approach solving a problem.
