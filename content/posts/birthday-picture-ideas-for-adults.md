what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.

Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.

Invention: The impact of invention on the economy
Invention has a profound impact on the economy. It could be said that without invention, there would be no modern day economy. Invention is the result of creativity and hard work, and it can have a significant impact on business and society. There are many different types of invention, but some of the most common are motorcycles, cars, laptops, and artificial intelligence. Each type of invention has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. For example, motorcycles are great for transportation because they're fast and easy to ride. However, they're not very good at getting people around in city streets or highways. Car manufacturers have been able to create more efficient cars by adding features such as automatic braking and air conditioning. This makes them much easier to use than other vehicles, but they also tend to be more expensive than others.
