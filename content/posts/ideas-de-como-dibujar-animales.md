How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you?
How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you? There are a number of ways to do this, but one of the most effective methods is by asking yourself what interests you. This will help you to develop ideas based on what you care about, and it will also help to narrow down your options. The next step is to look through existing ideas and see which ones might be a good fit for you. Once you have narrowed down your options, it’s time to start exploring them, by looking for examples and reading about them. Finally, keep in mind that not all ideas are created equal, so be prepared to test and experiment before making any decisions.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
