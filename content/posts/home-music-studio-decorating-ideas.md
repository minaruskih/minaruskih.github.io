The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.

coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.
