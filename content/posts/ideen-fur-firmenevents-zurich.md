The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

On the other hand, energy is becoming increasingly scarce, making it even harder for companies to come up with new ideas. But this isn’t stopping companies from trying – there are now dozens of startups that are using solar energy to create new products and services.

Creative problem-solving:
Creative problem-solving is a key part of any creative person’s toolbox. By solving problems, you can produce high-quality work. Here are a few tips to help you explore and solve creative problems:

2) Take your time. Don’t try to do too much at once. If you hurry, you might not get the results that you want or need. Time allows for moreassing thought and creates a better atmosphere for creativity.

3) Be patient. Don’t expect everything to go as planned the first time around.
