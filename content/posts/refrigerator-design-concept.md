2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility.

In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.

1. criteria your idea must meet: your target market, what they need, how you can improve on what they have already done
