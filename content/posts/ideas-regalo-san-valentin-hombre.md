What can we do to address the challenges?
There are many challenges facing the world today. One of the most pressing is climate change, which is melting ice caps and sea levels, disrupting food supplies, and affecting cities and rural areas around the planet. Another challenge is unemployment and wealth inequality, which have caused mass starvation in developing countries.

5th idea:
There are a lot of great ideas out there. But sometimes, it can be hard to come up with new ones. Here are five ways to get those creative juices flowing:
1. Take a walk: Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not even trying to think of them. So go for a walk, and let your mind wander.

2. Talk to people: Talk to friends, family, and strangers about their interests and passions. You never know what might spark an idea in your own mind.

3. Doodle: Don't worry about trying to draw something perfect or beautiful. Just let your pencil roam across the paper, and see what shapes and patterns emerge.

4. Play with toys: Toys are designed to stimulate creativity in children. So why not adults? Get out some LEGOs or coloring books and see what you can create.

There is no one answer to this question, as people come up with big ideas for different reasons. Some people may have big ideas because they are passionate about something, or they think that their idea could make a significant impact.
