The power of ideas: what are they?
Ideas are one of the most powerful things in the world. They have the ability to change the way we think, feel, and act. They can inspire us to do great things, or help us overcome difficult challenges.
Ideas can come from anywhere – from our own thoughts and experiences, or from other people. Sometimes, all it takes is a single thought or experience to change our lives forever. Other times, it may take many different ideas coming together to create a new way of thinking.

 either way, ideas have the power to change the world.

brainstorming: How do you come up with invention ideas?
Do you ever come up with ideas for products or services without knowing what they are? Or how to start thinking about them? In this article, we'll discuss brainstorming - the process of coming up with invention ideas.
There are a few different ways to brainstorm: by yourself, with a partner, or with a team. When brainstorming, it's important to be organized and have an idea hierarchy in mind. This will help you better understand the problem and potential solutions. Additionally, it can be helpful to have specific goals in mind before starting the brainstorming session. Once you've got your goals set, it's time to get creative! You can use any tool you like - including paper and pencils, a whiteboard, a computer screen, or even your iPod - but our favorite tool is a good old fashioned brainstorming session!
