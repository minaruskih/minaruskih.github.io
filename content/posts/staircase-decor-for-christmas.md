Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.

Evaluation: What factors do you need to consider when evaluation your Ideas?
Creative ideas are a valuable component of any business. However, they can also be a challenge to evaluate and assess. There are many factors you need to consider when evaluating your creative ideas. 
One important factor is the quality of your idea. If your idea is low quality, it will likely not be accepted by potential customers or partners. You must also consider the feasibility of your idea- does it actually have a chance of happening? If not, you may need to rethink your pitch and make sure the idea has enough potential to overcome any challenges. Additionally, you should measure the impact of your idea- is it worth risking money and time just to bring it to life? Finally, you must determine whether or not people will actually use your idea- is it something that people would want in their business? If not, you may need to revise or remove its from consideration.
