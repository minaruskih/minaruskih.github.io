What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it. 
2. Patenting: This is when someone else comes up with a similar idea to yours, but they have filed for a patent so that you can use their ideas legally. This can give you some control over your invention and make sure it's considered as an original work of art by the public.
