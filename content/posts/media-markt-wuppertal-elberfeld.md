Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.

Origins of creative art: The first artistic movements were inspired by nature and the then existing art form.
Creative art is the result of a fusion of nature and humans. The first artistic movements were inspired by both nature and the then existing art form. These movements were called Naturalism andAbstract Expressionism, respectively. As time passed, people's understanding of the world changed, and so did their ideas about art. So while Naturalism was inspired by the natural world, Abstract Expressionism was inspired by ideas that had yet to be created. As times changed, so too did creative art.
