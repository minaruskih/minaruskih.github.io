The Power of Ideas: What does it mean when you have great ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there is no one answer that is perfect. Great ideas come from all over, and can vary in terms of what they entail. However, the key to success with any idea is to have a clear vision for it and then make sure that the idea can be executed effectively. This means taking into consideration both the financial and logistical feasibility of bringing the idea to reality. Once those hurdles are overcome, great ideas often result in successful products or businesses.

The benefits of big ideas: How do they benefit society as a whole?
Big Ideas offer a way to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that can improve society as a whole. There are many benefits to big ideas, both private and public. Here are three of the most common: 
1) They inspire people to think about how they can improve their community and themselves. Big Ideas encourage people to question why things are the way they are and look for ways to make their world a better place. This can lead to change, both in the individual and community levels.

2) They help us confront problems we might not have seen before. Big Ideas give us new perspectives on how to solve problems and bring about change. This can be exciting because it allows us to see solutions that we might not have considered before.

3) They help us connect with others who share our same goals or values.
