How inventions are created: by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error
inventive ideas are created by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error. Sometimes, this process can be a lot easier than you think. If you're not sure how to start your own invention journey, here are five tips to get you started. 1) Think about what you want to create. What are your goals? What do you need to succeed? Once you have these answers, come up with a creative plan that will help achieve them. This will give you a better idea of what kind of ideas work and don't work for your product or service. 2) Be persistent. If it takes longer than expected to get started, don't give up! Keep at it until the project is more successful than when you started. 3) Take your time and make sure everything is in place before starting the experiment.
