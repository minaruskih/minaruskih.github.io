What is brainstroming and what does it do?
Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
There are already several companies that use brainstroming in their businesses. One company, called Cortex, sells an app called Brainstorm that helps you focus on specific problems and ideas to improve your problem solving skills. Other companies that are using brainstroming include Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. There is no single answer to how or when brainstroming should be used in business, but there are some key principles to follow if you want to try it out for yourself.

Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a machine, or a process. Inventors are people who come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. The first step in inventing something is to have an idea. Once you have an idea, you need to figure out how to make it work. This can be done by experimenting and trying different things.

What are some common mistakes people make when trying tobrainstrom?
When trying tobrainstrom, some common mistakes people make include not learning from their mistakes, thinking they know what they are doing, and underestimating the power of positive thinking. To help you avoid making these mistakes, here are a few tips: 1. First and foremost, be honest with yourself – ask yourself what specifically made you do something wrong the last time you tried brainstroming. If you can't answer this question, it's probably best not to try it again. Knowing your weaknesses will help you focus on attacking them rather than letting them sit there stagnant. 2. Next, work on your practice skills – if you're someone who struggles with problem-solving or strategy development, make sure to practice these skills regularly. This way, when you finally get started with brainstroming, you'll be well-prepared and comfortable starting out.

Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).
