Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.
