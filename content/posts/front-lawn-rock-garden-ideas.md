2) Talk to people who are knowledgeable about the area you're interested in. They may have some great insights that you hadn't considered before.

3) Don't get discouraged if your first few ideas aren't winners. Edison famously said that he didn't fail, he just found 10,000 ways that didn't work. Every "failure" brings you one step closer to success.
