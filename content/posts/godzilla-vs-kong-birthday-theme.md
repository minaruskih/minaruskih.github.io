The Importance of Innovation
Innovation is important for several reasons. First, without innovation businesses would become stagnant and eventually fail. To stay competitive, businesses must be constantly moving forward and improving upon their current offerings. Additionally, innovation can lead to new and improved products and services that customers will demand. Finally, innovation can help businesses to cut costs and improve efficiency.
In order to be successful, businesses must embrace innovation. Those that don’t will likely find themselves struggling to keep up with their competitors. Those that do will be well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities and continue growing.

Patenting: How do inventions work?
Patenting is the process of claiming a new invention as your own. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and can take anywhere from one to six months to be granted. Once granted, your invention can be used to protect it from others who may want to make a similar product or service.

Big Data: How big data is changing the way businesses operate and what implications this has for everything from marketing to customer service.
Big data is now a big part of business operations. How this affects everything from marketing to customer service is a topic of debate. Some businesses see big data as a way to increase efficiency and make decisions faster, while others are concerned that it could have negative consequences. Here are four examples of how big data is changing the business landscape:
1) They're using big data to assess customer needs and then cater to them with tailored marketing campaigns. Previously, businesses conducted marketing research through questionnaire surveys or focus groups. With big data, businesses can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze huge amounts of information about customers in order to better understand their needs and preferences. This allows companies to identify what products or services are most popular and need improvement, which in turn can lead to new product development or even new sales campaigns.
