Types of creativity: The five types of creativity.
Creativity is an important factor in any business. Whether itâ€™s a creative idea for a new product, or taking on a new challenge, creativity can help businesses succeed. Here are five different types of creativity that can help your business thrive: 
1. Idea generation: This type of creativity comes from having a creative thought and then coming up with an idea for a product or service. It can be helpful to come up with ideas for products that have never been created before, or products that are different from what is currently being sold. 
2. Innovation: This type of creativity comes from taking on a new challenge and seeing how you can improve upon what has been done before. It can be helpful to come up with ideas for products that are different in terms of design, structure, or function.

Definition of invention: What is it and what does it mean for society?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something existing. It can be anything from a new product to a new idea for a business. Inventions have a big impact on society because they can change the way we live and work. They can also create new opportunities for businesses and people.
One of the key definitions for invention is "a means of producing something which had not been produced before, or that is different from what has been produced previously." This definition encompasses everything from products to ideas to methods of transportation. Inventors are often incredibly creative and come up with amazing ideas that could change the world. Without invention, there would likely be very few innovations in our lives.

Invention has played an important role in human history since prehistoric times. For example, early humans used tools to make their way through life and get food and shelter.

A recent study found that people who are brainstroming are more creative and innovative than those who are not. This is because when people are brainstroming, they are thinking about one specific problem or idea and coming up with new ways to solve it.

How to implement Innovation in Your Business
Innovation is not a new concept to business. However, implementing it in a successful business can be quite the challenge. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Think about what you want your business to be known for. What does your target market want to know about you? How can your innovation help them achieve this? 
2. Try using multiple channels of communication. Not all communications are equal â€“ some are more effective than others. You may need to experiment with different methods before finding the one that works best for your business. 
3. Be willing to risk failure. When starting something new, thereâ€™s always a chance it wonâ€™t work out â€“ especially if you donâ€™t have experience or know how to do it well.
