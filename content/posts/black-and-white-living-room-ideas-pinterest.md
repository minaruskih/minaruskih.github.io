The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.

Get organized: What are some simple tips to make your home more efficient and organized?
In order to be more efficient and organized, it is important to have a plan. Here are some tips to help make your home more efficient and organized: 1. Make a list of all of your possessions - keep track of what you own and where you want it. This will help you keep track of what is belongs to you and where it is located. 
2. Keep your home clean - try to keep your home spick and span with regular cleaning routines. This will help improve organization and efficiency in your home. 3. Use common sense when organizing - think about things before moving them around or storageizing them. For example, if you have a refrigerator in one room, put all perishables in the fridge in that room instead of throughout the house.
