How to invent something: Share tips on how to come up with new ideas.
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, process or service. It’s a key part of innovation and economic growth. To be successful, you need to have a good idea and the drive to see it through.
So how do you come up with new ideas? There are a few methods you can try:

1. Brainstorming: This is a great way to generate ideas with a group. Get together with some friends or colleagues and just start throwing out ideas. The more outrageous the better – you can always tone it down later. The point is to get the creative juices flowing and come up with as many ideas as possible.

2. Research: Sometimes the best ideas come from understanding what already exists and finding ways to improve upon it.

Protectionism: How has protectionism affected invention propagation?
Protectionism has had a significant impact on the propagation of invention ideas. Invention ideas often originate from a new perspective or idea that is not protected by current legislation. Protectionism can stop these new perspectives from reaching a wider audience, and it can also limit the number of products that can be created based on an idea.

What are some big ideas?
1. Ideas for big changes or improvements can come from anything, but some things are more important than others. Examples of things that are more important include public opinion, financial stability, and the safety of our citizens.
2. A big idea can be something as small as making a change in how we operate our institutions or something as large as creating a new system that will work better for all involved. There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to big ideas, only what will make the world a better place.
