The Process of Idea Generation: How do you come up with ideas?
Ideas are important, because they can help you bring about changes in your life or in the lives of others. However, it can be tough to come up with ideas. There are a few key factors that can help you generate more ideas. The first is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. If you don’t know what you want, it’s hard to come up with ideas for it. The second factor is to be persistent. If you start thinking about something and not doing anything about it, the likelihood of carrying out your idea will increase. The third factor is to have a great idea. This requires both creativity and originality. If an idea is well-developed but not original, others may be more likely to adopt it. Lastly, make sure your idea is feasible.

Patent applications: What are the most common types of patent applications?
Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.
There are many different types of patent applications, but three main types are: utility patents, design patents, and copyrights. Each has its own specific benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to understand which type is best for your product or idea.

 Utility patents are the most common type of patent application, and they're used to protect ideas that have no practical use yet but could be very beneficial in the future. For example, a company might file a utility patent for a new product that can help cut energy costs.

Design patents protect specific features or designs of products.
