The Process of Idea Generation: How do you come up with ideas?
Ideas are important, because they can help you bring about changes in your life or in the lives of others. However, it can be tough to come up with ideas. There are a few key factors that can help you generate more ideas. The first is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. If you don’t know what you want, it’s hard to come up with ideas for it. The second factor is to be persistent. If you start thinking about something and not doing anything about it, the likelihood of carrying out your idea will increase. The third factor is to have a great idea. This requires both creativity and originality. If an idea is well-developed but not original, others may be more likely to adopt it. Lastly, make sure your idea is feasible.

Why it's important to have a growth plan
It's important to have a growth plan because it sets expectations for the future and helps you stay on track. By knowing what you want, and how to get there, you can create an achievable plan that will help your business grow. Here are three key ideas to help build your growth plan: 
1. Know your industry and where you fit in. Knowing where your business is in the market and what competition is doing will help you determine what needs to be done next in order for your business to stay afloat. 
2. Create a market research strategy. Doing market research will help identify which channels work best for your audience and which ones need more attention or marketing investment. Doing this before starting any new project helps minimize surprises later on. 
3. Set realistic goals and timetables.
