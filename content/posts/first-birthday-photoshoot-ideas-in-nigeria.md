The name comes from a phrase used by Eisenhower in his Farewell Address in 1961, where he spoke about the "massive national effort" which was needed to meet the challenges of the future.

The impact of ideas
How do ideas shape our world?
From the thoughts in our heads to the products on store shelves, ideas are responsible for everything around us. Every object we interact with was once just an idea in somebody’s head, and every object will one day be replaced by a new idea.

Ideas have always been important, but in today’s fast-paced, globalized world, they are more important than ever before. With technology making it easier than ever to share and develop ideas, the impact of a great idea can be felt almost immediately.

Whether it’s a new way to make money, a better way to make a product, or a new way to solve a problem, the right idea can change everything. And as we continue to face new challenges and opportunities, the power of ideas will only become more evident.
