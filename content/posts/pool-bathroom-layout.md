What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
