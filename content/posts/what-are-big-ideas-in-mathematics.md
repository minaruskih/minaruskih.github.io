The 4 types of ideas: creative, critical, problem-solving, and emotional
Creative ideas are always intoxicating, and can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing. However, it's important to be careful with what you create – too much creativity can lead to problems. Here are four types of ideas that can help you get your creative juices flowing: problem-solving ideas, emotional ideas, and critical ideas.
Problem-solving Ideas: 
1) Come up with ways to make the existing structure of your business more efficient or effective. This could mean finding ways to cut costs or improve efficiency, or coming up with new ways to appeal to customers. 
2) Use your creativity in order to come up with solutions to problems that have been bothering your customers for years. For example, if you're a restaurant, come up with new menu items that appeal specifically to people who are struggling financially.

Invention: The impact of invention on the economy
Invention has a profound impact on the economy. It could be said that without invention, there would be no modern day economy. Invention is the result of creativity and hard work, and it can have a significant impact on business and society. There are many different types of invention, but some of the most common are motorcycles, cars, laptops, and artificial intelligence. Each type of invention has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. For example, motorcycles are great for transportation because they're fast and easy to ride. However, they're not very good at getting people around in city streets or highways. Car manufacturers have been able to create more efficient cars by adding features such as automatic braking and air conditioning. This makes them much easier to use than other vehicles, but they also tend to be more expensive than others.
