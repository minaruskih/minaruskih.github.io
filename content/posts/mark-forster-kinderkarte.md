Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.

What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
