Forms of inspiration: What are some ways to get inspired when you’re working on a project?
Creativity is key when it comes to any project. There are many ways that you can get inspired, and some are more effective than others. Here are a few examples: 
1. Take a walk in the park: This can be an excellent way to get your creative juices flowing. Depending on what type of park you choose, there may be different types of attractions to inspire you.
