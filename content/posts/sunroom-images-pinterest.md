Conclusion: How to develop big ideas effectively.
Big ideas are the seeds that can turn a small idea into a big project or idea. They are the building blocks of success in any creative endeavor. By understanding how to develop big ideas effectively, you can make your projects more likely to succeed. 
To landscape a new garden, for example, it is important to understand the different types of plants and what they will grow in. To develop a plan for an office remodel, employees need to understand the different needs of each room and how best to layout them so that everyone has their space.
