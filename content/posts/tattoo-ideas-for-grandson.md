Innovation can occur in any area of business, but some are more prevalent than others. Here are six types of innovation:

2. Creative Innovation – This refers to using creativity and imagination to come up with novel solutions to problems or make better products. It often includes coming up with ideas that others wouldn’t think of and working tirelessly to bring them to fruition.
