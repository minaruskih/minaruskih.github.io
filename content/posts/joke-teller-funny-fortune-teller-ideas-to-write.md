What are your goals?
When it comes to goal setting, there are a few different things to consider. Whether you haveSpecific goals or general ones, the following are helpful tips:
1. Set specific deadlines: This is one of the most important things to remember when goal setting. If you don’t have a deadline, it will be much harder to get started on your goal. A good way to set a deadline is by saying that you want a certain outcome by a certain date (e.g., “I want my raise in two months”).

2. Create measurable goals: By using measurable goals, you can track and measure how well your goal is coming along. This helps you identify areas that need improvement and makes setting larger goals more manageable.

The 4 Types of Ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are what make our world go round. They can help us achieve our goals, change the course of history, or even save the lives of others. But what makes an idea unique? What make them different from other ideas?
There are four types of ideas: big ideas, innovative ideas, refreshed and fresh ideas, and breakthrough ideas.

Big Ideas: A big idea is something that is very new and different. It can be a way to solve a problem that people have been trying to figure out for years or it can be a solution to an old problem. A big idea can be anything from a new product to a new way of looking at life.

Innovation Ideas: An innovation idea is an idea that is new and different but still based on older principles or methods. Innovation ideas can range from simple solutions to complex problems.
