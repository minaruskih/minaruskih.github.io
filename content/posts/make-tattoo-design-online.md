What is brainstroming?
Are you feeling overwhelmed and lost? If so, you may be experiencing brainstroming. Brainstroming is a phenomena that occurs when one is overwhelmed and cannot think of anything to focus on. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and confusion. There are a few things that can help to improve your mental state while suffering from brainstroming. First, try focusing on why you are feeling overwhelmed. This could be as simple as identifying a specific task that you need to complete in order to feel better, or thinking about what others have said or done that has made you feel this way. Additionally, break down the task into smaller goals rather than trying to do the entire thing at once. Doing small tasks multiple times throughout the day will help keep your mind off of the larger issues at hand and will make it easier to stay focused on your goals.

Ideas that work: Why do some ideas work and others don't?
Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:
1. You have to be willing to try something.
2. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you.
3. Your idea might not be original, but it's more likely to work because it's been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking.
4. Your idea might be better than what's currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not – even if it doesn't quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!
