What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

Overcoming barriers to innovation
Innovation is essential for businesses to maintain a competitive edge, but it can be difficult to encourage employees to think outside the box. Overcoming these barriers is key to promoting a culture of innovation in your organization.
One barrier to innovation is risk aversion. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas for fear of being seen as failures if they don't work out. Encouraging a culture of experimentation can help overcome this hurdle by making it okay to try new things and fail.

Another common barrier is lack of resources. Employees may feel like they don't have the time or money to experiment with new ideas. Providing dedicated resources for innovation can help overcome this obstacle and show employees that you're serious about encouraging creativity.

Finally, some employees may simply be resistant to change. They may be comfortable with the way things are and see no need to innovate.
