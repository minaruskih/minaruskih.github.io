Tips for improving the appearance of your home
Looking to improve the appearance of your home? Here are a few tips to help!
1. Make use of natural light - All homes benefit from natural light, whether they're for sleeping or working in. In order to create this light, start by using windows and doors that open freely, and then keep your curtains and window treatments open.

2. Be creative - Not all home improvement projects are created equal. If you're looking to spruce up your space with some new decorating ideas, be sure to take into account what's important to you and what you can do with minimal effort. Try focusing on details like draperies or fabrics instead of overly-large changes.

3. Use common sense - When it comes to home decoration, be aware of the pitfalls that can often lead to a less-than-appealing final product.

What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.
