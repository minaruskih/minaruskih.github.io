Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work.

In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.
