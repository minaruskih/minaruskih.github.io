The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.

The three types of creativity: Intuition, Imagination, and Creativity
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and original ideas. It can come from any place in your head, but usually intuition comes first.
