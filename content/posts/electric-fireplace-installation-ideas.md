Cultural aspects of Invention: How do people React to Innovation?
When someone comes up with a new invention, people often react in different ways. Some people may be excited by the idea, while others may be skeptical. Still others may just be curious. Different reactions mean that different people have different perspectives on innovation. 
One example of how people react to innovation is through patenting. Patenting an invention means that somebody has made something that is exclusive to them and can't be copied or used by anyone else. This can help protect the inventor's work from being copied or used without permission. 

Another example of how people react to innovation is through creativity. When somebody comes up with a new idea, they may be inspired by it or they might not be. It all depends on the person and their perspective on innovation.

Tips for using creative ideas: How can you use your creativity to your advantage?
Creative ideas are a great way to come up with new and innovative ways to solve problems or create new products. However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your creative ideas are successful:
1) Make sure that your ideas are original. Don’t steal other people’s ideas, or use old ideas without giving them a fresh start.
2) Use your imagination. When you come up with creative ideas, don’t just think about what might work – try out different scenarios and see what comes up.
3) Get feedback from others. Take the time to ask people who have experience with the product or problem you’re thinking of solving how they would approach it. This will help you develop your idea into something that is both effective and appealing to potential customers.
