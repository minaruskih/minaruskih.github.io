Creativity is an elusive quality that many people try to define. There are many definitions of creativity, but they all share one common denominator: a sense of spontaneity and individual expression. Whether it's painting, writing, or sculpting, creativity has always been part of human experience. In fact, creativity may be even more innate than intelligence.

The power of big Ideas
Big ideas are the lifeblood of businesses and organizations. They can help change the course of history, create new products or services, solve difficult problems or change the way we live.
Here are four ways big ideas can help your business: 
1. Brainstorm new ideas with a group: With a few simple questions, you can generate dozens or even hundreds of potential ideas for your business. This way, you'll have a greater chance of coming up with something that will be interesting and innovative.
2. Test out new concepts: Once you've generated a number of potential ideas, it's time to test them out in an real-world situation. This means trying out different models, scenarios and models of how these products or services could work in order to see if they're actually feasible and profitable.

what is creative art?
Creative art is a form of expression that utilizes one or more creative mediums to convey feelings, thoughts, or ideas. The world of creative art is vast and ever-changing, making it one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of human endeavor.
There are countless forms of creative art, each with its own unique purpose and audience. Whether it’s a painting hung in a gallery or a performance piece staged in front of an audience, creative art has the power to provoke emotion and inspire thought.

At its core, creative art is about communication. It’s a way for artists to share their vision with the world, and for audiences to connect with the artist on a deeper level.

The four types of ideas: brainstorming, problem solving, creative writing, andPeak performance
Ideas can be thought of as a blank slate, which is why they are so powerful. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems, or to write creative works. However, Ideas should not be taken for granted- they can often be very challenging to achieve peak performance. Here are four tips for brainstorming and problem solving:
1. Be open to new ideas. Don't get too wrapped up in your own ideas and don't resist the urge to offer feedback. This will help you to develop better ideas and find better ways to solve problems.

2. Be realistic about what you're asking of your idea generation process. Don't try and create an idea that's too impossible or out of reach- let your creativity take over and see where it leads you!

3. Take time for reflection before starting the brainstorming process.
