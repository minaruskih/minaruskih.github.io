Ideas: What are some good ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to come up with new ideas and improve current ones. Here are a few ideas that may help you get started:
1. Create a new project or idea. This can be anything from designing a new shirt to coming up with a new business model. Just be sure that your idea is both innovative and feasible, as there is no guarantee that it will be accepted.

2. Take on an existing project. If your idea isn’t very different from what someone else has already done, it might be worth considering taking on an existing project. This can give you some experience and knowledge in the area in which you want to focus your efforts, as well as the support of other people who might have an expertise in that area.

3. Try out different methods ofexpression.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.

1) Understand your triggers: every time you experience an unpleasant or stressful event (like getting a new job), your body releases chemicals like glutamate from the brains cells in response. These chemicals can cause pain signals to be sent directly to your brain stem.
