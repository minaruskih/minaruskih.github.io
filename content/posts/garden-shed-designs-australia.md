The Problem/Solution: How do you come up with an idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to come up with an idea, but following a few simple steps can help. First, identify what you want to create. This can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Next, think about what others may have done or seen that would inspire you. If you have this kind of inspiration, you can begin working on your idea by imagining what people might be able to do with your product or service.
