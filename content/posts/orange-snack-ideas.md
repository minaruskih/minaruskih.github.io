Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
When it comes to creativity, we often think of artistic pursuits like painting or writing.  However, creativity is so much more than that. It’s about thinking outside the box, coming up with new ideas and solutions, and looking at the world in a different way.
In our fast-paced, constantly changing world, creativity is more important than ever. We need to be able to adapt and come up with new ideas to solve problems. If we get stuck in the same way of thinking, we’ll never progress.

So next time you’re feeling stuck, don’t give up. Take a step back and look at the situation from a different perspective. You never know what creative solution you might come up with.

Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.
