Invention ideas come from many sources. Some people get their ideas from listening to others, while others come up with ideas on their own. The best way to get invention ideas is to keep a notebook and write down every idea that comes to mind. Then, when you have some time, you can go through your notebook and see if any of your ideas are worth pursuing.

Creative expressions: What are they and how do they differ from regular expressions?
Creative expressions are different from regular expressions in that they make use of the imagination to create new and unique sentences. They can be used to match text against a set of specific criteria, or to identify patterns in text.
While regular expressions are widely used in text Morgan Kaufmann offers a number of creative expression tools to help you create more interesting and innovative sentences. These tools can be found on the left-hand side of the main Morgan Kaufmann page, under “Creative Expression”.

The value of creativity: What it is, how it can be used, and why it matters
Creativity is a important factor in any organization or enterprise. From product development and marketing to business strategy and communications, creativity is needed on all levels. There are many reasons why creativity can be so valuable, and one of the most important is that it can help solve problems.
One of the simplest ways to increase creativity is by providing an environment where people can express themselves freely. In an environment where creativity is encouraged, people are more likely to come up with ideas that may not have been thought of before. This can lead to new solutions being proposed, or even new products or services being created.

Another reason why creativity is so valuable is because it can be used to solve problems. When something feels impossible or difficult, often times creative minds are able to come up with solutions that seem impossible at first glance.
