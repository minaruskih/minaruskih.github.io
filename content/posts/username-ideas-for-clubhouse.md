The definition of creativity
Creativity is a wide and undefined term that can mean many different things to many different people. To some, creativity means experiencing new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply having fun. To others, creativity means being able to come up with solutions to problems or coming up with unique ideas that other people might not have thought of. There is no right or wrong answer to this question as what matters most is how you use creativity in your life.

Ideas for Art and Design: What are some possibilities?
Creative ideas abound when it comes to art and design. From something as simple as a new piece of jewelry to an elaborate design for a home, there are endless possibilities when it comes to both. Here are a few ideas that photographer and creative writer Damon Knight has come up with himself:
1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.

What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.
