The Future of Work: What needs to be done to keep people employed?
There is no doubt that the future of work is fraught with uncertainty. There are many reasons for this, but one big factor is the increasing use of technology. The way that technology affects work and jobs is changing constantly, so it's important to keep up with the latest trends. Some ideas that could help to keep people employed include: 
1) More job flexibility – as technology advances, it becomes easier and more affordable for people to change their working hours or locations whenever they feel like it. This means that there are more opportunities for people to work from home, which can be a great way to stay on top of your schedule and stay organized. 
2) Better communication between employers and employees – not everyone needs the same level of communication when it comes to working with their boss.

How can innovation be used in business?
Innovation is a key concept in business. It allows businesses to change and improve their products and services in order to meet customer needs. Airlines, for example, use innovation to improve the service they provide. In the medical field, innovations such as vaccines and artificial intelligence can help doctors diagnose and treat patients faster. Businesses can also use innovation to increase their profits. For example, Google's Street View was used to map out areas of cities where they could find potential customers. This allowed them to better target their advertising campaigns and increase profits.
