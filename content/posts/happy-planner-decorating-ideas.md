What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make things better. From new ways to solve problems to coming up with unique ways of selling products, there are endless creative possibilities out there. Here are a few examples that might be of interest to you:

What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the activity of brainstorming. Brainstorming is an effective way to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. When done correctly, brainstroming can lead to improved business plans, strategies and operations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when trying to achieve brainstroming success.

1) Brainstorming should be formed into teams or groups in order to provide more cohesion. This will help prevent members from working on individual projects at the same time.
2) Brainstorming should be focused on solving real-world problems rather than just coming up with new ideas. This will help your team become more knowledgeable about the problem at hand and can help you develop better solutions.

Dark Side of the Coin: How can we make sure that our happiness doesn't come at a cost?
What does the dark side of the coin mean for happiness?
Some people might say that there is a cost to happiness, and this cost can be significant. For example, when people are unhappy, they may spend less money on goods and services, or they may reduce their social engagement. This could lead to a decrease in overall well-being.
There are also costs associated with being happy. For example, people who are happier tend to have healthier lifestyles and have fewer health problems. They also tend to enjoy life more and feel closer to others. These benefits could last for a long time if done consistently.
Many experts agree that there is a cost to happiness, but they differ on how large it may be.

Invention as a Tool for Progress
Invention has always been an important tool for progress. From the invention of the printing press to the development of the internet, invention has helped make societies and economies better. 
However, some inventors have argued that invention is not only a valuable tool, but it can also be used to hinder progress. For example, many people believe that the patent system is too slow and restrictive, which encourages innovation while hindering creativity. Others worry that Invention may eventually become a Replication Service instead of a Tool for Progress.

Regardless of whether or not inventions hinder progress, they remain an important part of human history and culture. In his book "Inventing the Future", John Seelye argues that innovation is essential to our future and that unless we encourage it, we will see stagnation and decline.

Definition of a "new idea"
A new idea is a re-interpretation or expansion of an old concept that has been brought to a new level of understanding or application.
