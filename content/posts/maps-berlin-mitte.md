Creative egg: What is a creative idea?
Creative ideas are a way to get your creative juices flowing. Whether it’s coming up with an idea for a new project or coming up with ways to improve an existing one, creativity is key. However, not all creative ideas are good. Here are five examples of the worst creative ideas you could come up with:
1. Coming up with a name for your business that is unique and not easily copied
2. Planning to travel to every corner of the world and never leave your house
3. Coming up with a unique advice column that will be popular and useful
4. Creating an app that can be used by anyone, regardless of their skill level
