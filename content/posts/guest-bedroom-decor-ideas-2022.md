Why is it so difficult to come up with big ideas?
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, there are a few things that can help. One is having a strong idea base, which is the ability to think of similar ideas and come up with concepts that work together. Another is being able to simplify things, which is essential when thinking about complex problems. Finally, having the guts to try something new and seeing if it works out can be an important part of any big idea brainstorming process.
