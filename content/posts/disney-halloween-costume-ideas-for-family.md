What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.
