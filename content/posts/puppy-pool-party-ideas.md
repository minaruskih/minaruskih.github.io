The Importance of Being Creative: Why it's important to be creative when coming up with invention ideas.
Coming up with invention ideas requires a lot of creativity. After all, if you can't think of something new, you'll never be able to invent it.
But why is creativity so important when it comes to invention? For one, it allows you to come up with ideas that are truly original. And when you have an original idea, you're more likely to succeed because no one else has thought of it before.

Plus, being creative means that you're not afraid to take risks. And taking risks is essential when it comes to inventing something new. If you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve anything great.
