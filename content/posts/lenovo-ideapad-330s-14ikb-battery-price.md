Creativity in the workplace
A recent study has shown that creativity in the workplace is on the decline. This is due to a number of factors, including the increased pressure to succeed and the lack of time to truly be creative. However, there are a few ways to encourage creativity in the workplace.
One way to encourage creativity in the workplace is to set aside time for brainstorming sessions. During these sessions, employees should feel free to share any ideas they have, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. The goal is to get employees thinking outside of the box and coming up with new and innovative ideas.

Another way to encourage creativity in the workplace is to offer incentives for coming up with new and creative ideas. This could be anything from a cash bonus to extra vacation days. Whatever the incentive may be, it should be something that employees are motivated to achieve.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new, or changing something existing. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that it is "the act or process of converting a potential failure into a successful outcome." 
It can be seen as a way to improve the quality and efficiency of an organization's operations, as well as create new opportunities for business growth. 
The key to success in any innovation endeavor is ensuring that the innovation does not detract from the company's primary focus, which may be its core business.
