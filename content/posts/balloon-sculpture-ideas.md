Creative use of space in art: How space can be used to create a new environment for the artist or to convey a message
Creative artists use space to create new environments and communicate their messages. In some cases, the artist uses the space to tests their ideas, in other cases it is used as a dumping ground for materials or inspiration. Regardless of its intended use, creative art relies on the creativity of the artist and the ability to think outside the box.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.

Ideas for the economy: How can we create more jobs and reduce unemployment?
How can we create more jobs and reduce unemployment?
There are many ways to create jobs and reduce unemployment. The economy is constantly changing, so new ideas for creating jobs and reducing unemployment are always being developed. Here are some ideas that could help the economy grow and increase employment: 
-Encourage entrepreneurship: The more people who start their own businesses, the more jobs they can create. This will help to reduce unemployment as businesses become stronger and offer new products and services. 
-Upgrade infrastructure: Improved transportation, communication, and industry means that more people can be employed in various fields. This will also lead to less need for housing, which in turn will lead to an increase in employment opportunities. 
-Create job training programs: Training people into new positions can help them find work when they start a job.
