How to have more ideas
The ability to have more ideas is a key skill for any entrepreneur or business person. However, not all ideas are equal and some may be better than others. To find the best ideas, it’s important to assess how well they align with your goals and objectives. Here are three tips on how to have more ideas:
1. Assessment: Without giving your idea too much thought, it’s natural to want to rush into anything without first assessing its potential risks and benefits. The first step in assessing an idea is to understand its key benefits and how they could impact your business or product. Once you know these things, you can determine if the idea has potential for success.

2. Evaluation: Evaluating an idea requires taking the time to figure out what it could do for your business and what challenges you may face along the way.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of making a new and improved product or service. Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche. Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries. Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.

Prototype creation
Inventors often have a great idea for a product or invention, but don't know how to create a prototype. There are many ways to create prototypes, and the best method depends on the type of product or invention. Here are some tips for creating prototypes:
If you have an idea for a physical product, the best way to create a prototype is to find someone who can help you build it. This could be a friend or family member who is good with tools, or you could hire a professional. Once you have your prototype, you can show it to potential investors or manufacturers to get feedback and interest in your product.

If your invention is more of an intangible concept, such as a new app or software program, you can create a prototype yourself using basic coding language. This will give you a chance to test out your idea and see if it's feasible.
