Ideas are a valuable resource for any business and it is important to ensure that ideas are exploited in order to improve the company’s performance. In order to capitalize on ideas, businesses should develop a process for vetting andscoring ideas. This way, ideas are properly considered and evaluated before they are implemented. By doing this, businesses can avoid creating new projects that are too risky or difficult to execute, and also avoid taking risks with their competitive advantages.
