Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.

What are some potential risks associated with innovation?
There are a variety of potential risks associated with innovation, but one of the most important is the risk that new ideas and technologies can be dangerous or harmful. For example, some think that the invention of the airplane could lead to increased danger to passengers and crews. Another concern is that innovations in technology can help our environment become increasingly worse.
