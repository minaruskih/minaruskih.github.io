Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

The five types of ideas: creative,icidal, practical, educational, and entertaining.
Creative ideas can be anything from cleaning up your basement to starting a business. They can be fun and enjoyable, or they can have a serious purpose. Educational ideas are important, especially for younger generations who are just starting out in life. They can help teach them about different topics and how to get things done. Practical ideas are great for people who need to do things quickly or who don't have time to waste. Some examples of practical ideas include becoming a doctor, lawyer, or mechanic. The last type of idea is the most interesting and entertaining, because it can bring people together in a shared interest. For example, if you're an artist, you might want to start a painting blog or create a YouTube channel about your work.
