What are the benefits of having big ideas?
Big ideas can have a number of benefits, including making you more creative, sparkling your thinking, and sparking new insights. Here are five reasons why having big ideas is important: 
1. Youâ€™ll be more creative: The more you think out loud, the easier it is for your brain to come up with new ideas. When you have big ideas in your head, youâ€™re less likely to be stuck on something and more likely to come up with a solution that meets both your needs and the task at hand. 
2. Youâ€™ll be sparkier: If you can see what other people could do better than you, it will make it easier for you to come up with new solutions.

Creative process: how do we go about creating art?
In order to create art, there are a few key stages that must be gone through in order to produce successful pieces. Here are some tips on how to get started: 

1. Understand your purpose or vision for the artwork. Once you have a clear idea of what you want your piece to represent, itâ€™s important to figure out how you want it to look. This can involve designing the layout and graphics yourself, or using free software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. 
2. Be honest with yourself and others. When starting out, itâ€™s important not try to be too artsy or fancy. Just aim to create something that is interesting and engaging for your audience- whether thatâ€™s friends, family, or strangers.
