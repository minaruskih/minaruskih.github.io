Solution: How can we do it?
One potential solution to the migration of large numbers of people is to provide easier and faster access to the necessary visas and entry into the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has created a website that allows citizens of many countries, including China, India, and Russia, to apply for visas without having to go through a travel agent. This online system is known as the Visa Waiver Program. The program allows people from these countries to enter the United States for tourist or business purposes without first obtaining a visa. The website also offers information on how toapply for visas and what documents are needed in order to apply.
