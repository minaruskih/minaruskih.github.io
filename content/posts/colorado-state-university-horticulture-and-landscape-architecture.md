The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.

creating a plan: What are some steps you need to take in order to create a successful idea?
Creative ideas can be a huge asset to any business. However, they can also be extremely difficult to come by. In order to create a successful idea, you need to take some key steps. Here are some tips: 1. Brainstorming- It’s important to have an idea for something before starting the brainstorming process. This will help you come up with a great plan and ideas for what to pursue. 2. Diversification- If your idea is focused only on one market or industry, it will likely not be successful. You need to have at least two different ideas in mind before starting the development process. 3. Innovation- Another key factor in creating a successful idea is innovation.
