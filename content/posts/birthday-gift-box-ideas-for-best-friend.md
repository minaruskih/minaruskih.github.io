How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that involves the use of imagination and creativity. It is important to note that creativity does not work in a straight line, but rather it is constantly evolving. This means that it can change and develop over time. Creative art often contains elements of the Unknown or the inexplicable, which allows for the viewer to interact with the artwork in a different way than if it were just a series of instructions written down.

What are some of the best ways to improve your home?
There are many ways to improve your home, but one of the best ways is to do it yourself. Here are some of the best ways to improve your home: 
1. Add more storage: If you don’t have enough storage space, add extra cabinets, shelves, or boxes. This will give you more room to organize and store your belongings.

3. Check for code violations: If you live in an apartment or condo, make sure to check for code violations often. This will help you identify potential problems with your building that can be improvement-ized such as window soundproofing or insulation changes.
