Creativeblocking: What is it and how can it help you be more creative?
Creativeblocking is a term that has been mentioned in a few places, but mostly as an afterthought. Most people seem to think of it as a thing that happens to creatives when they try to do something new or different, and it takes up space in their brain. But what is creativeblocking really? Is it something that you have to experience for yourself to understand, or can it be learned? Here are 8 things you need to know about creativeblocking if you want to be more creative: 
1) It starts with setting your boundary

One of the best ways to help avoid blocking creativity is by setting boundaries early on. When you know what your limits are, you can get more out of your creativity. This means setting clear expectations for yourself and not trying to do too much at once.
