How to generate Big Ideas: How do you generate big ideas?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to generate big ideas, but there are a few key things to keep in mind. The first is that different people have different ways of generating ideas. Some people prefer to think out loud, while others prefer writing down their thoughts. It doesn’t matter what type of idea you come up with – just be sure that it’s something that you can actually put into action and make a difference in your life. 
The second thing to note is that big ideas don’t always have to come from scratch. Sometimes, you can take what you know and use it to help develop new ideas. For example, if you know that you could improve your business by creating more customer service skills, then you might want to start thinking about how you can do this.
