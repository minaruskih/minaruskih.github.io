When they come up with a new idea, they often have no idea how it will turn out but that doesn’t mean it won’t be creative.

How to Pitch an Idea: Tips for successful pitches
Ideas are a powerful tool for selling and developing products. If you can come up with good ones, your pitch will be more successful. Here are some tips for creating an idea pitch that will be successful:
1. Start by identifying what your product or service does that others don't. This can be difficult, but it's important to think about the problem someone else is trying to solve.
2. Find a analogy or metaphor that resonates with your target audience and helps explain how your product or service would solve that problem.
3. Be clear and concise when describing what your product or service does and how it would benefit customers. Your target audience will appreciate clarity in their purchase decision-making process.
4. Demonstrate why people should buy your product or service instead of those of your competitors.
