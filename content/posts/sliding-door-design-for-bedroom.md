The Invention Process: Describe the steps involved in coming up with an invention idea.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By following a few simple steps, you can turn your idea into a reality.
The first step is to come up with an idea. This can be anything that you think would make life easier or more fun. Once you have an idea, the next step is to do some research. See if anyone has already invented what you're thinking of, and if so, how you can improve upon it.

After doing your research, the next step is to develop a prototype. This is a working model of your invention that you can use to test how well it works and make any necessary improvements. Once you're satisfied with your prototype, the final step is to patent your invention and start mass-producing it for the world to enjoy!
