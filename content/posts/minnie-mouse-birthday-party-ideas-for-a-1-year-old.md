What makes big ideas smart?
When it comes to big ideas, a little bit of thinking and creativity goes a long way. That’s why smarter ideas tend to be ones that are well-executed and scalable. Here are five ways to make your big ideas smarter:
1. Cut out the guesswork: By thinking ahead, you can remove any potential ambiguity or uncertainty. This will help you create a more organized plan and ensure that your idea is well-oiled from the get-go.
