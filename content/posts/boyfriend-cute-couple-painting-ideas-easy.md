Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.

Conclusion: Some ways to come up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.
