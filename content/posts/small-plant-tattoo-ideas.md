Prototype creation
Inventors often have a great idea for a product or invention, but don't know how to create a prototype. There are many ways to create prototypes, and the best method depends on the type of product or invention. Here are some tips for creating prototypes:
If you have an idea for a physical product, the best way to create a prototype is to find someone who can help you build it. This could be a friend or family member who is good with tools, or you could hire a professional. Once you have your prototype, you can show it to potential investors or manufacturers to get feedback and interest in your product.

If your invention is more of an intangible concept, such as a new app or software program, you can create a prototype yourself using basic coding language. This will give you a chance to test out your idea and see if it's feasible.

What are the benefits of big ideas?
There are many benefits to big ideas, including increased creativity, innovation, and productivity. However, there are also a few key considerations that should be taken into account when creating big ideas. Here are four tips to help you create better big ideas:
1. Be clear and concise: The more information you can provide in a clear and concise manner, the easier it will be for others to understand your concept and develop a plan for implementing it.

2. Be realistic: Always be honest with your expectations and goals when developing big ideas. Don’t try to “solve everything” – instead focus on areas that can be quickly improved or neglected.

3. Get input from others: When developing your big idea, always consult with others in order to get their feedback and thoughts on the idea before moving forward.
