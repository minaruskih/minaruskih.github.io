    Ideas can be anything and everything. They can be new ways of looking at an old problem, or new ways to approach an old one. They can be a way to think about something that you've never thought of before, or a way to come up with a solution to a problem that you've never even contemplated. Ideas are the lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we might just as well give up.
