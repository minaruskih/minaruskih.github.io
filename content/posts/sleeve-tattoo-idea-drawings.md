Tips for Developing an Invention Idea: Brainstorming, Ideation, and Brainstorming Tools
When brainstorming, it can be helpful to have a variety of ideas floating around in your head. There are several brainstorming tools that can help you get started: ideation, brainstorming, and problem-solving. Some tips on how to use these tools effectively are as follows: 
1. Always have a notebook with you when you are brainstorming. This will help you keep track of all the different ideas that come up. 
2. Use different language whenbrainstorming. French is often used for brainstorms because it is easy to remember sounding terms and words. Other languages may also be used depending on the topic at hand.
