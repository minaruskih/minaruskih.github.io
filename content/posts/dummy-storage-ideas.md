Definition of creativity: What does it mean for a person to be creative?
Creativity is defined in many ways, but at its root it is the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts that have never been thought of before. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to do something or coming up with a way to improve an existing product, creativity is always a huge part of any individual’s life.
