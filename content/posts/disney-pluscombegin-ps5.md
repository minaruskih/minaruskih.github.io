The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality?

Conclusion: Some tips for starting off on a fresh thinking project.
When starting a new project, it can be helpful to have fresh ideas in tow. Here are a few tips to help you get started:
1. Take your time - don't rush the process. This will help you stay organized and focused on what you're working on.

2. Be open to feedback - always work with someone who has an opposing view to get their insights on the project. This will help you figure out where you need clarification and where things could be improved.

3. Break the project down into smaller tasks - this will make it easier to pay attention to each step and make sure that everything is moving along as planned.

4. Don't be afraid of change - change is always a good thing, especially when it comes to projects, since they can often provide new perspectives and opportunities for growth.

Definition of big ideas: What are some examples?
Big ideas are ideas that have the potential to change the world. They are often large and ambitious, but they can be implemented easily and quickly. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income: This idea would give everyone a fixed amount of money every month without any strings attached. It would help to lift people out of poverty and into a higher paying job.

2. A gender-neutral pronoun: This could be a huge political and social shift, as it would redefine what it means to be human. Additionally, it would help to break down many gender-based stereotypes.

3. A digital divide: This is a term that refers to the fact that many people in developed countries have more access to technology than those in developing countries. The digital divide has contributed to many social problems, such as inequality and poverty.
