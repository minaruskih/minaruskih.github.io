Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.

What to include in your blog:
Blogging can be a fun and rewarding way to share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas with the world. However, not all bloggers have everything they need in their blog to make it successful. Some bloggers may lack important pieces of equipment or content that can damage their blog's popularity and cause them to lose traffic and followers. Here are some tips on what to include in your blog so that you can achieve great success:
