CreativeWork: What makes a good creative idea?
Creative ideas are not only great for businesses, but also for individuals. Whether you’re a creative artist or just want to come up with new ideas, creativity is essential. There are certain things that make good creative ideas, and these are often based on your own experience or what you’ve learned. Here are some things to consider when coming up with your next idea: 
1) What is your target audience? When you come up with an idea, be sure to think about what kind of message or product you’d like to reach out to. Is it just for yourself, or do you have an audience in mind? 
2) What can you realistically accomplish? Are there any challenges that you can overcome using your creativity? If so, make sure they’re still worth considering.

Limitations of innovation: What are some common limitations to innovation?
The challenges of innovation are well known, but how often do we take the time to understand the limitations of innovation? These limitations can stem from a number of factors, including historical precedent, cultural norms, financial resources, and other constraints.
There are a few key limitations to innovation that should be taken into account when seeking new ideas or concepts:

1. Limitations on creativity: Innovation often comes with a risk of becoming boring or incremental. When trying to come up with new ideas, it is essential to be creative and innovative. However, not all innovations are capable of achieving this level of creativity. In fact, many innovations fall victim to this limit because they lack the ability to surprise or dazzle the audience. This can make it difficult for customers and employees to accept an innovation as new and different than what they have been used to before.
