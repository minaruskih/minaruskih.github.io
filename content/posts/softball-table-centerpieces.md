What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.
