Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not yet known to anyone. Invention can come from anything, from a simple solution to a very innovative product. It can also come from a small isolated town in the middle of nowhere, and it can be done by someone who is just starting out. Inventions have made significant impacts on society and the economy, and continue to do so today.
