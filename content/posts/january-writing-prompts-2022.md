Overcoming Obstacles to Inventing
Inventing is often hailed as the key to success, but it's not always easy to come up with new ideas. Here are some tips for overcoming obstacles and generating invention ideas.
1. Brainstorm with a group of people. Collaboration can help spark new ideas and help you see problems from different angles.

2. Take inspiration from other inventors. Study how they came up with their groundbreaking ideas and try to apply those same methods to your own thinking.

3. Be persistent and don't give up.Search for solutions until you find one that works for you. Inventing is often a trial-and-error process, so don't be discouraged if your first few attempts fail.
