How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

How to Choose the rightDIY Project:
Choosing the right DIY project is important, especially if you want to create something for your own pleasure or use it as a learning opportunity. Here are four tips to help make the process easier:
1. Decide what you want your project to achieve. If you’re looking to make a simple change to your home or improve an existing piece of furniture, there are many possibilities out there. However, if you’re planning on creating something more comprehensive or complex, be sure to research the different types of dyes and materials before starting.

2. Consider your budget. Just because you can do something yourself doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea. Factor in both the cost of materials and the time it will take to complete your project.
