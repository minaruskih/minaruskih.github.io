How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.

The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.
