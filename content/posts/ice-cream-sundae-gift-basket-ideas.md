Limitations of innovation: What are some common limitations to innovation?
The challenges of innovation are well known, but how often do we take the time to understand the limitations of innovation? These limitations can stem from a number of factors, including historical precedent, cultural norms, financial resources, and other constraints.
There are a few key limitations to innovation that should be taken into account when seeking new ideas or concepts:

1. Limitations on creativity: Innovation often comes with a risk of becoming boring or incremental. When trying to come up with new ideas, it is essential to be creative and innovative. However, not all innovations are capable of achieving this level of creativity. In fact, many innovations fall victim to this limit because they lack the ability to surprise or dazzle the audience. This can make it difficult for customers and employees to accept an innovation as new and different than what they have been used to before.
